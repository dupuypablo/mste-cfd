  abstract={Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) can perform general-purpose computations in addition to the native specialized graphics operations. Due to the highly parallel nature of graphics processing, the GPU has evolved into a many-core coprocessor that supports high data parallelism. Its performance has been growing at a rate of squared Moore's law, and its peak floating point performance exceeds that of the CPU by an order of magnitude. Therefore, it is a viable platform for time-sensitive and computationally intensive applications. The lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) computations are carried out via linear operations at discrete lattice sites, which can be implemented efficiently using a GPU-based architecture. Our simulations produce results comparable to the CPU version while improving performance by an order of magnitude. We have demonstrated that the GPU is well suited for interactive simulations in many applications, including simulating fire, smoke, lightweight objects in wind, jellyfish swimming in water, and heat shimmering and mirage (using the hybrid thermal LBM). We further advocate the use of a GPU cluster for large scale LBM simulations and for high performance computing. The Stony Brook Visual Computing Cluster has been the platform for several applications, including simulations of real-time plume dispersion in complex urban environments and thermal fluid dynamics in a pressurized water reactor. Major GPU vendors have been targeting the high performance computing market with GPU hardware implementations. Software toolkits such as NVIDIA CUDA provide a convenient development platform that abstracts the GPU and allows access to its underlying stream computing architecture. However, software programming for a GPU cluster remains a challenging task. We have therefore developed the Zippy framework to simplify GPU cluster programming. Zippy is based on global arrays combined with the stream programming model and it hides the low-level details of the underlying cluster architecture.}

The averaging step, used by the latter method to derive macroscopic quantities, is suppressed, as well as the associated fluctuations. The collision operator is expressed in terms of its linearized part, and condensed into a few parameters, which can be selected, independently of a particular collision rule, to decrease viscosity as much as desired.}

  abstract={We propose the lattice BGK models, as an alternative to lattice gases or the lattice Boltzmann equation, to obtain an efficient numerical scheme for the simulation of fluid dynamics. With a properly chosen equilibrium distribution, the Navier-Stokes equation is obtained from the kinetic BGK equation at the second-order of approximation. Compared to lattice gases, the present model is noise-free, has Galileian invariance and a velocity-independent pressure. It involves a relaxation parameter that influences the stability of the new scheme. Numerical simulations are shown to confirm the speed of sound and the shear viscosity.}

The non-equilibrium dynamics is investigated numerically and found to agree with simple analytic predictions in both the one-phase and the two-phase region of the phase diagram.}

  abstract={This paper reviews methods and applications of the phase field technique, one of the fastest growing areas in computational materials science. The phase field method is used as a theory and computational tool for predictions of the evolution of arbitrarily shaped morphologies and complex microstructures in materials. In this method, the interface between two phases (e.g. solid and liquid) is treated as a region of finite width having a gradual variation of different physical quantities, i.e. it is a diffuse interface model. An auxiliary variable, the phase field or order parameter ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0034-4885/71/10/106501/rpp172184in001.gif] {\phi(\vec{x})} , is introduced, which distinguishes one phase from the other. Interfaces are identified by the variation of the phase field. We begin with presenting the physical background of the phase field method and give a detailed thermodynamical derivation of the phase field equations. We demonstrate how equilibrium and non-equilibrium physical phenomena at the phase interface are incorporated into the phase field methods. Then we address in detail dendritic and directional solidification of pure and multicomponent alloys, effects of natural convection and forced flow, grain growth, nucleation, solid–solid phase transformation and highlight other applications of the phase field methods. In particular, we review the novel phase field crystal model, which combines atomistic length scales with diffusive time scales. We also discuss aspects of quantitative phase field modeling such as thin interface asymptotic analysis and coupling to thermodynamic databases. The phase field methods result in a set of partial differential equations, whose solutions require time-consuming large-scale computations and often limit the applicability of the method. Subsequently, we review numerical approaches to solve the phase field equations and present a finite difference discretization of the anisotropic Laplacian operator.}

   abstract = {In this work we use two numerical methods which rely only on the geometry and material parameters to predict capillary hysteresis in a porous material. The first numerical method is a morphological pore network (MPN) model, where structural elements are inserted into the imaged pore space to quantify the local capillary forces. Then, based on an invasion-percolation mechanism, the fluid distribution is computed. The second numerical method is a lattice-Boltzmann (LB) approach which solves the coupled Navier-Stokes equations for both fluid phases and describes the dynamics of the fluid/fluid interface. We have developed an optimized version of the model proposed in [Tolke J, Freudiger S, Krafczyk M. An adaptive scheme for LBE multiphase flow simulations on hierarchical grids, Comput. Fluids 2006;35:820-30] for the type of flow problems encountered in this work. A detailed description of the model and an extensive validation of different multiphase test cases have been carried out. We investigated pendular rings in a sphere packing, static and dynamic capillary bundle models and the residual saturation in a sphere packing. A sample of 15 mm in diameter filled with sand particles ranging from 100 to 500 pm was scanned using X-rays from a synchrotron source with a spatial resolution of 11 mu m. Based on this geometry we computed the primary drainage, the first imbibition and the secondary drainage branch of the hysteresis loop using both approaches. For the LB approach, we investigated the dependence of the hysteresis loop on the speed of the drainage and the imbibition process. Furthermore we carried out a sensitivity analysis by simulating the hysteretic effect in several subcubes of the whole geometry with extremal characteristic properties. The predicted hysteretic water retention curves were compared to the results of laboratory experiments using inverse modeling based on the Richards equation. A good agreement for the hysteresis loop between the LB and MPN model has been obtained. The primary and secondary drainage of the hysteresis loop of the LB and MPN model compare very well, and also the experimental results fit well with a slight offset of 10% in the amplitude. Differences for the first imbibition have been observed, but also large differences between two different experimental runs have been observed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Pore-network models have been used to describe a wide range of properties from capillary pressure characteristics to interfacial area and mass transfer coefficients. The void space of a rock or soil is described as a network of pores connected by throats. The pores and throats are assigned some idealized geometry and rules are developed to determine the multiphase fluid configurations and transport in these elements. The rules are combined in the network to compute effective transport properties on a mesoscopic scale some tens of pores across. This approach is illustrated by describing a pore-scale model for two- and three-phase flow in media of arbitrary wettability. The appropriate pore-scale physics combined with a geologically representative description of the pore space gives a model that can predict average behavior, such as capillary pressure and relative permeability. This capability is demonstrated by successfully predicting primary drainage and waterflood relative permeabilities for Berea sandstone. The implications of this predictive power for improved characterization of subsurface simulation models are discussed. A simple example field study of waterflooding an oil-wet system near the oil/water contact shows how the assignment of physically-based multiphase flow properties based on pore-scale modeling gives significantly different predictions of oil recovery than using current empirical relative permeability models. Methods to incorporate pore-scale results directly into field-scale simulation are described. In principle, the same approach could be used to describe any type of process for which the behavior is understood at the pore scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Three mathematical models (mixed side-pore diffusion (MSPD) and profile side-pore diffusion (PSPD) with uniform or distributed pore lengths) are derived in dimensionless form to simulate the transport of solutes through the flowing channels and the stagnant pores of an unsaturated heap. Model parameters are determined from experimental tracer residence-time distributions using the least-squares minimization approach. It is shown that the residence-time distribution curves display a long tail resulting from the very slow mass transfer (or diffusion) into the 1- to 6-cm-long stagnant pores, which take up 5 times more space than the flowing liquid. The very large coefficients of determination (R-2 > 0.99) confirm the validity of all models and especially that of the PSPD model with a distributed pore length. The effects of five factors (agglomeration, addition of binder, particle size, solution flow rate, and bed height) are examined. Data from experimental residence-time distributions prove that the advection time is directly proportional to the column height and inversely proportional to the flow rate. The two estimated parameters (stagnant liquid holdup and pore length) are only marginally affected by any change in crush size, agglomeration technique, or operating conditions. This, in turn, suggests that the model can predict and/or simulate the hydrodynamic behavior in taller columns and, possibly, heaps.},

The computational models of such processes need to account for variably saturated liquid flow in porous media, gas flow through porous media, together with the transport of many species in one of these fluid phases plus multi-phase heat transfer and mass transfer arising from a range of phase change and gas-liquid-solid chemical reaction processes.

   abstract = {The hydraulic conductivity function, which is required to solve the Richards equation, is difficult to measure. Therefore prediction methods are frequently used where the shape of the conductivity function is estimated from the more easily measured water retention characteristic. Errors in conductivity estimations can arise either from an invalidity of the prediction model for a given soil, or from an incorrect description of the retention data. This second error source is particularly important for soils with heterogeneous pore systems that cannot be adequately described by the usually used retention functions. To describe the retention characteristics of such soils, a flexible theta(psi) function was formed by superimposing unimodal retention curves of the van Genuchten (1980) type. By combining this retention model with the conductivity prediction model of Mualem (1976), conductivity estimations for soils with heterogeneous pore systems are obtained. Estimated conductivities by this model and the classical van Genuchten-Mualem method can differ by orders of magnitude. Thus reported disagreements between measured and estimated conductivities may in some cases be due to an inadequate description of the retention data rather than due to a failure of the prediction model.},

The concept of stagnant-layer diffusion is used to describe the interface mass transfer, where calculated local concentrations control the rates of mass transfer.

In particular, Kozeny's equation k is-proportional-to phi(b)BAR between effective permeability and bulk porosity and the relation k is-proportional-to F(-h) between permeability and formation factor are analyzed. A simple and general consolidation model is introduced. It is based on the reduction of local porosities and emphasizes the general applicability and flexibility of the local-porosity concept.

   abstract = {The usual macroscopic equations of motion for two-phase immiscible displacement in porous media are known to be physically incomplete because they do not contain the surface tension and surface areas governing capillary phenomena. Therefore, a more general system of macroscopic equations is derived here that incorporates the spatiotemporal variation of interfacial energies. These equations are based on the theory of mixtures in macroscopic continuum mechanics. They include wetting phenomena through surface tensions instead of the traditional use of capillary pressure functions. Relative permeabilities can be identified in this approach that exhibit a complex dependence on the state variables. A capillary pressure function can be identified in equi librium that shows the qualitative saturation dependence known from experiment. In addition, the proposed equations include a description of the spatiotemporal changes of residual saturations during immiscible displacement.},

Wetting phenomena and hysteresis in porous media are at present poorly understood in the sense that neither in physics nor in engineering a fully predictive theory seems to exist, that can describe or predict all observations. This paper extends the consitutive assumptions of a recent approach based on the concept of hydraulic percolation of fluid phases. The theory proposed here allows prediction of residual saturations. It can describe displacement processes in which imbibition and drainage occur simultaneously. This contrasts with the established traditional theory where capillary forces are lumped into capillary pressure function and relative permeabilities, and these functions need to be specified for each displacement process as input. Contrary to the traditional theory the approach advanced here allows to predict capillary pressure saturation relations as output.},

It takes into consideration a typical configuration of phase distribution within pores in the form of a repetitive field of mobile menisci. These phase interfaces give rise to the appearance of a new term in the momentum balance equation, which describes a vectorial. field of capillary forces. To derive the model, a phenomenological approach is developed, based on introducing a special continuum called the Meniscus-continuum. Its properties, such as a unique flow velocity, an averaged viscosity, a compensation mechanism and a duplication mechanism, are derived from a microscale analysis. The closure relations to the phenomenological model are obtained from a theoretical model of stochastic meniscus stream and from numerical simulations based on network models of porous media. The obtained transport equation remains hyperbolic even if the capillary forces are dominated, in contrast to the classic model which is parabolic. For the case of one space dimension, the analytical solutions are obtained, which manifest non-classical effects as double displacement fronts or counter-current fronts.},

All the important features of immiscible fluid flow at the pore scale, such as wetting layers, spreading layers of the intermediate-wet phase, hysteresis, and wettability alteration are implemented in the model. Wettability alteration allows any values for the advancing and receding oil-water, gas-water, and gas-oil contact angles to be assigned. Multiple phases can be present in each pore or throat (element), in wetting and spreading layers, as well as occupying the center of the pore space. In all, some 30 different generic fluid configurations for two- and three-phase flow are analyzed. Double displacement and layer formation are implemented as well as direct two-phase displacement and layer collapse events. Every element has a circular, square, or triangular cross section. A random network that represents the pore space in Berea sandstone is used in this study. The model computes relative permeabilities, saturation paths, and capillary pressures for any displacement sequence. A methodology to track a given three-phase saturation path is presented that enables us to compare predicted and measured relative permeabilities on a point-by-point basis. A robust displacement-based clustering algorithm is also presented.},

The LB computations, based upon actual channel geometry derived from X-ray computed tomographic imagery, reveal that the variation in conductance for channels having similar shape factor is much larger than is adequately captured by the geometric models. Fits to the dependence of median value of conductance versus shape factor from the LB-based computations show a power law dependence of higher power than that predicted by the geometric models. We introduce two network flow models based upon the LB conductance computations: one model is based upon LB computations for each pore-to-pore connection; the second is based upon a power law fit to the relationship between computed conductance and throat shape factor. Bulk absolute permeabilities for Fontainebleau sandstone images are computed using the SR-based network models and the two LB-based models. Both LB-based network models produce bulk absolute permeability values that fit published data more accurately than the SR-based models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The permeability evolvement law was disclosed. The results indicate that before leaching the permeability of the ore granular media in different height has not much difference and the value ranges from 5.70 x 10(-4) mm(2) to 1.11 x 10(-3) mm(2), where the lowest one locates in the bottom zone. After leaching the permeability distributes inhomogeneously along the height of the column and the value ranges from 3.44 x 10(-4) mm(2) to 2.25 x 10(-2) mm(2), where the lowest one is in the same place. Except for the bottom zone, the permeability of other zones increases after leaching, especially the top zone. Through comparison of the permeability at bottom zone before and after leaching, the whole permeability after leaching decreases by 39.65% that coincides with the measured experimental data.},

   abstract = {To date the microporosity structures of coarse soils with various coarse/fines contents are still not fully understood. In this study, the pore-size distributions (PSDs) of five types of soil varying from gravel to clay were characterized using mercury intrusion porosimetry. The soil with a coarse content below 70% (i.e., fines content above 30%) is found to have a fines-controlled microstructure, which is sensitive to water content changes. Such soil forms a dual-porosity structure due to compaction, in which both intraaggregate pores and interaggregate pores are dominant. After saturation, the dual-porosity structure evolves into a unimodal porosity structure dominated by the intraaggregate pores. During drying, such soil exhibits a significant reduction of total volume. The soil with a coarse content above 70% instead has a coarse-controlled microstructure, which is stable upon water content changes. Such soil maintains dual-porosity structures no matter if the soil is compacted, saturated, or dried. As an example of application, the measured PSDs are used to predict the soil water characteristic curves (SWCCs) for the test soils and the predictions are consistent with the SWCCs measured in the laboratory.},

   abstract = {Two problems that arise in the use of the continuum diffusion-reaction model to describe diffusion and reaction in pore networks are investigated: (i) the question of whether the appropriate value of the effective diffusivity is different from the one measured or calculated in the absence of reaction, and (ii) the magnitude of the error involved in applying the continuum model to a network close to its percolation threshold (i.e. one in which the blocking of a few pores would cause the network to become disconnected), where it is expected on theoretical grounds to break down. We have carried but numerical simulations of diffusion and reaction in model pore networks and compared the results with solutions to the continuum model. We find that the continuum model with an effective diffusivity calculated in the absence of reaction is in good agreement with the pore network simulations, except where the reaction occurs mostly within a few pore lengths of the particle surface (or the surface of the microparticles for a catalyst with a bidisperse structure) or where the network is very close to the percolation threshold. In these circumstances, diffusion and reaction should be simulated directly using a pore network model.},

   abstract = {Heap leaching is a process extensively used by the mining industry to recover metals from large quantities of submarginal material resources. Understanding flow through a packed particle bed is important to enhance the performance of heap leaching with respect to design and operating considerations. The microstructure and connectivity of pore space are important features to describe detailed fluid flow phenomena in heap leaching operations. In this regard, a milli-CT scanner was used to determine the complex pore structure of a packed column before and after bioleaching of copper ore. The 3-D reconstructed images of complex pore structures obtained from the milli-CT scans were used for the analysis of saturated flow inside the leaching column based on lattice-Boltzmann (LB) simulations.

Symposium on Upscaling Downunder

   abstract = {We present a process based method for reconstructing the full three-dimensional microstructure of sandstones. The method utilizes petrographical information obtained from two-dimensional thin sections to stochastically model the results of the main sandstone forming processes - sedimentation, compaction, and diagenesis. We apply the method to generate Fontainebleau sandstone and compare quantitatively the reconstructed microstructure with microtomographic images of the actual sandstone. The comparison shows that the process based reconstruction reproduces adequately important intrinsic properties of the actual sandstone, such as the degree of connectivity, the specific internal surface, and the two-point correlation function. A statistical reconstruction of Fontainebleau sandstone that matches the porosity and two-point correlation function of the microtomography data differs strongly from the actual sandstone in its connectivity properties. Transport properties of the samples are determined by solving numerically the local equations governing the transport. Computed permeabilities and formation factors of process based reconstructions of Fontainebleau sandstone compare well with experimental measurements over a wide range of porosity.},
